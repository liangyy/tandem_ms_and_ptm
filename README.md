This is a repository for a little review paper in Chinese about tandem MS in the discovery of PTM in lysine. The file name has this the format `s[N]_[content].txt`. `N` means the number of section and `content` indicates the content of this section.

The table of content is as follow:

# 1 Intro to proteomics (`s1_proteomics.txt`)

This section tells general background of proteomics including what is proteomics, why we need it, and what technology is used.

## 1.1 What is proteomics 

Answer what and why problem, namely to analyse a composited proteins or peptides mixture and to figure out the existance and amount of each chemical species.

## 1.2 Technologies 

Introduce gel electropherosis and the general work flow of whole cell proteomics. Then, introduce a little bit about mass spectrometry.

# 2 Intro to tandem MS

This section tells some details of MS/MS technology and how data is analysed.

## 2.1 How it works

Decribe how tandem MS signal is generated.

## 2.2 Data analysis

Introduce the existing methods to extract peptide and protein information from tandem MS data and focus on especially how PTM is analysed. List the challenges of PTM analysis and introduce some recent methods to tackle this problem.

# 3 Case study

This section decribes some research paper under this topic and the papers are split into two types based on their research strategy.

## 3.1 Guess PTM first

## 3.2 Guess protein first
